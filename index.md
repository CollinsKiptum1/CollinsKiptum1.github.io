## 🧠 About Me

I'm an enthusiastic Network Engineer who takes advantage of open-source network simulators to upskill and grow in the field.

I thrive in roles that require securing networks, managing systems, and staying ahead of cyber threats. My interests lie in **ethical hacking**, **threat detection**, and learning how attackers think — so I can stop them before they act.

Currently, I’m building a strong foundation in **Cloud Security** and **real-world incident response**. A key part of my journey is hands-on practice in platforms like **TryHackMe**.

Outside of tech, I enjoy nature walks and hanging out with friends — especially at karaoke nights for a fun reset. 🎶🌿
